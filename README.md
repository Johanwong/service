For each meetup we will try to prepare short screencasts and other materials with different assignments. For all who want to do more there will also be homework so learners will be able to practice their spells.

We also encourage all the participants to have some project they want to work on (but if they don't, no worries, will help them find one).

First meeting is going to be informal and will include helping learners get set up with Linux and getting started with some of the basics. The "formal" class part will begin the second week.

# Materials

Coding in schools
Changing a profession
Women in tech
http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/10/ada-lovelace-walter-isaacson-innovators/
Connect with local influencers:

after school private tutoring
apply for local/remote jobs
make protfolio
make certificates (for local influencers)
WHY (Problem, now)
Statistics show:
50-80% of all current jobs are at risk of being automated in the coming decade
programming is the new literacy people need to know to utilize this automation

WHAT (Goal, future)
Turning all kinds of people into programmers or at least give them enough understanding so that they can enhance their work skills with a bit of programming and to have in general a better understanding of programming and technology to be able to continue to learn and to be able to follow what's going on in this world and how technology is shaping our future

HOW (Solution, process)
It's possible to actually become a programmer and do something useful in 1-2 years of intensive practice. An online curriculum, where people go through a structured series of video tutorials and code examples, which explain them step by step how to build a basic app will get them there. Later they can modify and change this example app to something else and continue their process.
