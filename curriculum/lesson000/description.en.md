In the future more and more jobs will demand the knowledge of programming, so in order to not be left behind and to have nice opportunities for your future, it is really important to add this skill to your existing knowledge base.

There is many languages you can learn, but in the past years, JavaScript is becoming like english of programming languages. With it, you can build web pages, mobile apps, control drones, do VR, data analysis and many more. It is very universal and it is growing in popularity.

There are also many ways how you can use JavaScript. You can use some frameworks (Angular, React, Ember etc.), but with these frameworks it often happens they are popular today and tomorrow no one uses them. So if you invest into learning a certain one, you can't be sure, it is going to be the right one.

That is why we teach pure JavaScript and so called hyper modular development, where you use lots of little programming libraries and combine them the way you want and stay flexible and able to adapt to new trends/needs.

So, based on all this and our offline learning school, we developed a curriculum to teach complete beginners.

You start with setting up your environment: Gmail, Chrome, Bookmarks, 5 finger Typing, Github etc.

Next, you start learning ABC of JavaScript (syntax, grammar). Because this is a pure theory, we figured out, the best way is to use CodeCombat, a game that helps you learn the syntax without making it too dry and boring. This way you repeat things and in between you will find videos with theoretic summary of what you have learned so far, so keep watching videos.

And after CodeCombat game, the real thing starts. You build your first portfolio web page and learn how to retrieve data from the database, how to do simple animations etc. Then we continue with building your first web app (a quiz) and later we learn how to transform this quiz into a mobile app.

After that more tutorials come, but this is the first batch. So, join us and get started.

For all the questions, you have a chat and the community is more than happy to help you with answers.
